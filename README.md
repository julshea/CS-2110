# CS-2110
Work from CS 2110 (Software Developmemt Methods) at the University of Virginia.

Lab Descriptions:

Lab 2: Writing whole classes that interact with eachother, by implementing book and person objects. Each person will keep track of which books they have read.

Lab 3: Further developing experience with class interaction and junit testing. This lab involves writing a library class that interacts with the objects from lab 2 by keeping track of people's membership and the books they have checked out.

Lab 4: Reading from files and handling basic errors safely, and implementing two APIs that interact. Additionally, gaining experience with the interfaces Comparable and Comparator, as well as implementing a new interface titled "Playable".

Lab 6: Gaining experience with concurrency and recursion. 

Lab 7: Practing writing recursive methods for binary trees, and gathering an in-depth introduction to this data structure.
